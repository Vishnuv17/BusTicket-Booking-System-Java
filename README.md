# BusTicket-Booking-System-Java

The Bus ticket booking system is allowing users to enter personal details and book a ticket with a seat type and price. A unique ticket ID is generated upon booking, and users can view their ticket details by entering the ticket ID. The system calculates the price based on seat type (Regular, Business, First Class). It also includes basic validation to ensure required fields are filled. The user interface is structured with panels for input and ticket display, making the application interactive and user-friendly.

Technologies Used: The system uses Java Swing for the GUI and event-driven programming to manage ticket booking and viewing. It generates unique ticket IDs using Java's Random class and displays details with JOptionPane.
